Either just having the government acquire some amount of said non-voting stock from each company as a service fee for providing legitimacy to their corporate charters by enforcing them, or privately putting together an organization of some sort that exists for the sole purpose of donating dividends beyond what it reinvests to just slightly outpace inflation to the state/federal treasury to effectively remove them from the economy.

That way the higher corporate profits are, the faster money is removed from circulation, while either arguably or very much not technically being a tax depending on which of the two above ways it's implemented.","1669363827","Meticulac","1542841086",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.neoliberal","true","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_z47vri","false","6","0","false","some_ads","/r/neoliberal/comments/z47vri/using_dividends_from_nonvoting_stock_to_fight/","false","false",,,"1673204855","1","true","false","false","neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","r/neoliberal","142544","public",,,"0","0.53",,,"some_ads",,,,,

""Black workers would be among the first to lose their jobs if unemployment spikes, since they're disproportionately concentrated in industries sensitive to economic downturns. Racial discrimination often influences choices made by companies about which workers to fire, economists said.""


If inflation keeps up businesses have to raise pay to incentivize employees to keep working.

Meanwhile those with debt will end up with relatively less debt.

While the rich who own the debt will be worse off.

Thus inflation seems to me to be the great balancer.

By trying to aggressively stop inflation it seems to me the Federal Reserve is fighting for the rich.

Low income wages have outpaced inflation so far.

"yw6e4n","Does more people graduating high school and getting degrees actually improve the economy/society, or does it just create an inflation of knowledge?","self","I'm just observing the trend of more people finishing high school and going to college.  In the old days, I hear if you had a high school diploma, you were set, and college was just an extra thing some people did.  Now, it's increasingly becoming the standard to have some sort of college degree.  And you see the shift in the other areas as well: it seems that your occupational opportunities with just a diploma today are about what they were for people who dropped out back in the day. 

So are we improving things or just inflating our diplomas and degrees?  

I guess maybe a better educated population could produce more inventions and innovations, but I question even this point, as educational institutions tend to yield cookie-cutter thinkers.

.....

But I will say certificates for trades have remained a far more stable currency.  They're seriously underrated: go to school for less than a year and come out able to make more than people with certain bachelor's or even master's degrees.  

I wonder why they haven't seen the same extent of inflation.  Maybe they're more firmly grounded in reality, only teaching you exactly what you need to know for that specific skill?","1668538941","Terrible-Trust-5578","1611207162",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.Discussion","true","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_yw6e4n","true","7","0","false","all_ads","/r/Discussion/comments/yw6e4n/does_more_people_graduating_high_school_and/","false","false",,,"1673214471","1","true","false","false","Discussion","t5_2qho1","r/Discussion","13170","public","top",,"0","0.67",,,"all_ads",,,,,

"y2e2am","Is fighting inflation worth the cost?","self","**The numbers:** U.S. wholesale prices rose 0.4% in September to mark the first increase in three months, signaling little progress in the Federal Reserve’s fight to vanquish high inflation.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.2% gain. Wholesale prices had fallen in August and July entirely because of declining gasoline prices.

The increase in wholesale prices over the past year, meanwhile, fell slightly to 8.5% from 8.7% in the prior month. Inflation is still running near a 40-year high, however.

A separate measure of wholesale prices that strips out volatile food and energy costs also increase 0.4% last month, [the government said Wednesday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm). That was a larger than expected.

\-----

With the above in mind, the customary approach is to raise interest rates, raise the reserve rate, and sell bonds, all of which will slow the economy and cost jobs.

These job losses will be borne mostly by people on the margins...POC, single women, the young, etc.

Is it worth the cost to fight inflation?

The customary view among many is that inflation is transitory and is caused by supply chain issues.

"y52a04","Question about inflation and the Fed’s response to it","self","I have a question regarding the mechanics of inflation reduction.

I get, at its core, inflation just results from a mismatch wherein demand exceeds supply throughout an economy or for certain key goods that have downstream effects on prices e.g. oil cost increases make transportation more expensive, leading to higher shipping costs which are passed down to consumers as higher prices.

And I understand that the logic of interest rate hikes is to make it more expensive to borrow in order to curb consumer demand and allow supply to catch back up to demand.

My question is though, wouldn’t rate hikes also have an adverse effect on producers that are trying to expand their productive output? In the example of the chip shortage leading to inflation in consumer tech goods, new chip fabrication equipment and facilities are very capital intensive - in order to alleviate inflation in consumer tech, presumably we would want to incentivize tech firms to invest in expanding their productive capacity to meet demand - but wouldn’t raised interest rates also have the effect of making it more difficult for firms to expand productive capacity due to borrowing costs for PPE?

Or is this basically a chemo-esque shotgun approach of slowing all consumption and just hoping that consumer consumption slows more than producer purchasing?","1665877977","Pheer777","1369263305",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.neoliberal","false","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_y52a04","false","3","0","false","some_ads","/r/neoliberal/comments/y52a04/question_about_inflation_and_the_feds_response_to/","false","false",,,"1668033159","1","true","false","false","neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","r/neoliberal","140624","public",,,"0","0.67",,,"some_ads",,,,,

"xldisg","Why do you think economic concerns (inflation, stagflation/recession fears) have not substantially hurt Democrats in the polls? Has political polarization reached a point where economic issues no longer matter?","self","Here are some of the most common arguments (and corresponding counterarguments) I've heard from reading political analyses.  

|Argument|Counterargument|
|:-|:-|
|1.  The job market is still strong.|1a.  Wages are not keeping up with inflation.  A strong job market primarily benefits those looking to make career changes, a minority of workers.|
||1b.  70% of US economists are predicting a recession within the next 2 years.  The Federal Reserve is projecting unemployment to rise by at least 1%.|
|2.  Social issues (abortion, immigration, CRT, etc.) have taken precedence over the economy.|2.  Most Americans, at least when responding to polls, still cite economic concerns as most important, even if they don't vote that way.|
|3.  Gas prices have fallen significantly in the last 3 months.|3.  Gas/oil prices aren't the only component of inflation.  Food, rent, and services are the key inflation drivers right now.|
|4.  Republicans have not established a clear cause &amp; effect between specific Democrat policies &amp; the current inflation surge.|4a.  Trump left office with inflation (12-month CPI) at 1.4%, and it never rose above 2.9% during his presidency.  The first inflation spike from 1.4%  to 5% coincided with the passage of the American Rescue Plan.|
||4b.  Historically, the party in power tends to get blamed for the economy, regardless of policies.  George W. Bush's approvals slid to 26% by 2008, leading to a Democratic landslide.|
|5.  Republicans have not presented credible policy proposals to lower inflation.|5.  The ones they're highlighting right now are (a) incentivizing domestic oil production to lower oil prices further, and (b) reducing regulations &amp; taxes on American businesses so they can boost supply. |
|6.  The class inversion (white collar moving towards Dems, blue collar to GOP) has insulated Dems' base from economic problems.|6a.  At the end of the day, inflation still affects everyone.  Inflation is hitting everything from basic necessities to luxury items.  |
||6b.  The wealthy also tend to have more savings &amp; investments.  Stocks &amp; bonds have lost 20%+ of their value this year.|","1663881170","sfrogerr","1531616429",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.PoliticalDiscussion","false","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_xldisg","true","48","0","false","all_ads","/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/xldisg/why_do_you_think_economic_concerns_inflation/","false","false",,,"1665437415","0","true","false","false","PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","r/PoliticalDiscussion","2185699","public","confidence",,"0","0.44",,,"all_ads",,,,,

Appreciate this isn’t ELI5, but indulge me if you wish as I do want to understand: If I run a playground and have a bank that has 500 Monopoly notes which I give out to the other kids, who then choose to use the notes to buy and sell services, and I borrow another 200 notes from another playground and give them out, I get that this may cause people to charge more as there is more money in circulation, but why is this bad for my playground?","1663490974","ijustwanttolisten","1659078932",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.neoliberal","false","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_xhbicy","false","5","0","false","some_ads","/r/neoliberal/comments/xhbicy/does_debt_cause_inflation/","false","false",,,"1665443442","9","true","false","false","neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","r/neoliberal","139603","public",,,"0","1.0",,,"some_ads",,,,,

"xosul5","Genuine question for you guys: If the current inflationary problems cannot be solved without drastic cuts in government spending and the weakening of labour power, doesn’t that show that capitalism requires poverty and is therefore morally inexcusable?","self","According to most of the economists I’ve read, the major causes of the current inflation crisis are:

1) Covid killed a bunch of workers in the logistics sector 

2) Covid lockdowns caused a bunch of businesses in various key sectors to scale back production because there was lower demand

3) Various forms of economic stimulus to keep people from being made destitute by the aforementioned lockdowns resulted in the majority of the population being able to keep consuming at the same rate as they were pre-Covid, which since the businesses had scaled back production meant that demand exceeded production.

In order to combat inflation, most central banks are advising drastically cutting back government spending and raising interest rates to reduce the average currencies purchasing power. However, since covid spending did not improve ordinary peoples circumstances it just maintained them at their current levels, in practice this will drive millions into poverty.

And this is my question: Larry Summers et al are basically demanding that some proportion of the world population is pushed into poverty in order to stop inflation; however the fundamental idea of neoliberal capitalism is that the growing economy lifts all boats. These two ideas seem to be in conflict, if these economists are correct then it means that under a capitalist system you need a certain percentage of the population to be under the poverty line, otherwise inflation kicks in and the whole system collapses.

"zentll","Rising inflation brings striking fall in real wages, ILO report finds","self"," [GENEVA (ILO News) – The severe inflationary crisis combined with a  global slowdown in economic growth – driven in part by the war in  Ukraine and the global energy crisis – are causing a striking fall in  real monthly wages in many countries.](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_862321/lang--en/index.htm)  
 

According to a new  International Labour Organization (ILO) report, the crisis is reducing  the purchasing power of the middle classes and hitting low-income  households particularly hard.    
 

The [*Global Wage Report 2022-2023: The Impact of inflation and COVID-19 on wages and purchasing power* ](https://www.ilo.org/digitalguides/en-gb/story/globalwagereport2022-23),  estimates that global monthly wages fell in real terms to minus 0.9 per  cent in the first half of 2022 – the first time this century that real  global wage growth has been negative.    
 

Among advanced G20  countries, real wages in the first half of 2022 are estimated to have  declined to minus 2.2 per cent, whereas real wages in emerging G20  countries grew by 0.8 per cent, 2.6 per cent less than in 2019, the year  before the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 

“The multiple global crises we  are facing have led to a decline in real wages. It has placed tens of  millions of workers in a dire situation as they face increasing  uncertainties,” said ILO Director-General, Gilbert F. Houngbo. “Income  inequality and poverty will rise if the purchasing power of the lowest  paid is not maintained. In addition, a much-needed post pandemic  recovery could be put at risk. This could fuel further social unrest  across the world and undermine the goal of achieving prosperity and  peace for all.”   

## Inflation has a greater impact on low-wage earners

The  cost-of-living crisis comes on top of significant wage losses for  workers and their families during the COVID-19 crisis, which in many  countries had the greatest impact on low-income groups.   

 The report shows that rising inflation has a greater cost-of-living  impact on lower-income earners. This is because they spend most of their  disposable income on essential goods and services, which generally  experience greater price increases than non-essential items.  

 Inflation is also biting into the purchasing power of minimum wages, the  report says. Estimates show that despite nominal adjustments taking  place, accelerating price inflation is quickly eroding the real value of  minimum wages in many countries for which data is available. 

## Regional differences

The report, which includes regional and  country data, shows that in the first half of 2022, inflation rose  proportionately faster in high-income countries than in low- and  middle-income countries, leading to the following regional real wage  trends:   
  

* In Northern America (Canada and the United  States), average real wage growth slid to zero in 2021 and dropped to  minus 3.2 per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In Latin  America and the Caribbean, real wage growth declined to minus 1.4 per  cent in 2021 and minus 1.7 per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In  the European Union, where job retention schemes and wage subsidies  largely protected employment and wage levels during the pandemic, real  wage growth increased to 1.3 per cent in 2021 and declined to minus 2.4  per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In Eastern Europe, real  wage growth slowed down to 4.0 per cent in 2020 and 3.3 per cent in  2021, and fell to minus 3.3 per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In  Asia and the Pacific, real wage growth increased to 3.5 per cent in  2021 and slowed down in the first half of 2022 to 1.3 per cent. When  China is excluded from the calculations – considering the large weight  the country has in the region – real wage growth increased by much less,  at 0.3 in 2021 and 0.7 per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In  Central and Western Asia, real wage growth grew strongly by 12.4 per  cent in 2021 but slowed down to 2.5 per cent in the first half of 2022.
* In  Africa, evidence suggests a fall in real wage growth to minus 1.4 per  cent in 2021 and a decline to minus 0.5 per cent in the first half of  2022.
* In the Arab States, wage trends are tentative, but  estimates point to low wage growth of 0.5 per cent in 2021 and 1.2 per  cent in 2022.","1670374927","Augustus--","1482194347",,"false",,,"false",,,"self.neoliberal","false","0","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","true","false","false","false","t3_zentll","false","4","0","false","some_ads","/r/neoliberal/comments/zentll/rising_inflation_brings_striking_fall_in_real/","false","false",,,"1673192772","13","true","false","false","neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","r/neoliberal","142532","public",,,"0","0.89",,,"some_ads","self",,,,
